title: About

I'm a graduate of [UAE University's](https://www.uaeu.ac.ae/en/) Electrical Engineering program. Besides most things electrical (except power transmission), I'm in love with computer architecture, low-level software, and web app development.

In Spring 2018, I graduated with a MSc in ECE from Georgia Tech.

Right now, I am working as a software engineer at Google.

I've built projects in Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, Scala, Java, C++, and MATLAB. Check out the [Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/) page for more details. I'm familiar with quite a few other languages, and I'm confident I can pickup any new language, not counting the esoteric ones (I'm looking at you, APL/J/K), in a short amount of time.

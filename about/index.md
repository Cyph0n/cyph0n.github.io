## Who am I?

My name is Assil Ksiksi.

I'm an Electrical Engineering senior at UAE University. Besides most things electrical (except power transmission), I'm in love with computer architecture, programming, compilers, and web app development.

## What have I done?

I've built projects in Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Scala, Java, C++, and MATLAB. Check out the [Projects]({{ site.author.url }}/projects.html) page for more details. I'm familiar with quite a few other languages, and I'm confident I can pickup any new language, not counting the esoteric like APL and friends, in a short amount of time.

You may have noticed that the projects I've worked on during my free time are not at all related to my major. The way I see it is that I spend more than enough time working on EE subjects, so I'd rather spend my free time learning something else. Thankfully my hobby provides an alternate career path in case EE doesn't work out for some reason.

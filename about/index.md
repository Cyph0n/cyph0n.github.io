title: About
---

I'm an Electrical Engineering senior at UAE University. Besides most things electrical (except power transmission), I'm in love with computer architecture, programming, compilers, and web app development.

I've built projects in Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Scala, Java, C++, and MATLAB. Check out the [Projects]({{ site.author.url }}/projects/) page for more details. I'm familiar with quite a few other languages, and I'm confident I can pickup any new language, not counting the esoteric like APL and friends, in a short amount of time.

You may have noticed that the projects I've worked on during my free time are not at all related to my major. The way I see it is that I spend more than enough time working on EE subjects, so I'd rather spend my free time learning something else. Thankfully my hobby provides an alternate career path in case EE doesn't work out for some reason.

I plan on applying to a PhD in EE this semester. My current list is MIT, Berkeley, Purdue, UMelb, and ANU. I'm not entirely sure I see myself in academia in the future, but I think a PhD is a good career goal for people who are not satisfied with the status quo and are interested in furthering science in general.

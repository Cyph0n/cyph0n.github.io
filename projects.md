## Planning Phase

### Online Marketplace for Tunisia

A website that makes it easier for buyers and sellers to find each other in my home country Tunisia. Major hurdles include providing shipping for buyers countrywide at a reasonable cost, and handling payments online.

* Backend
    - Scala
    - Play Framework
    - Slick ORM?
* Frontend
    - Bootstrap
    - React
    - Underscore

### BTC Tunisia

An online Bitcoin wallet/exchange for use in Tunisia. Due to strict currency controls, it is impossible to send Tunisian Dinar out of the country. As a result, Tunisians cannot buy things online, or send money to friends and relatives abroad. I plan on releasing a MVP with some advertising to see if the idea has potential.

* Backend
    - Scala or Python
    - Play Framework or Django
    - Slick (?) or Django ORM
    - A solid Bitcoin blockchain in Java or Python
* Frontend
    - Bootstrap
    - Backbone or React
    - Underscore

## Completed/Cancelled

### [Jadawil](http://jadawil.herokuapp.com)

A course scheduler for UAE University students. Jadawil makes it extremely easy to schedule course timings during a busy semester. It also takes final exam conflicts into account.

### dubizzle

A scraping-based API for Dubizzle, a classified ads website based in the UAE. This project actually got me a job offer at Dubizzle!

### cspice

A simple circuit simulator written in C++. I had ambitious plans for the functionality initially:

* Transient analysis and DC operating point
* SPICE-like syntax parser
* Support for R, L, C, as well as diodes and transistors
* Plotting via gnuplot
* REPL for interactive simulation; insert or delete components in real-time without editing the circuit's netlist

I ended up implementing only a small subset of the above. It was done as a course project.

### STracker

A task tracker written during my internship at Schlumberger. The idea was for it to improve workshop efficiency by displaying current maintenance tasks for each technician on a large LCD display. I wrote it using Node.js and NW.js.

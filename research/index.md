### Intelligent Traffic Alert System (iTAS)

We built a prototype road safety alert system that uses the commercial FM band to deliver audio and digital information to a vehicle using its FM radio. You can find out more from a draft of the paper [here](http://1drv.ms/1ON0nb5).

**Update 05/11/2015:** Our paper has been accepted at [IEEE Smart City 2015](http://umc.uestc.edu.cn/conference/SmartCity2015/index.php)!
